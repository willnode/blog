title: Journey to Higher Dimension
---

With my current development to [Forth Engine](https://forth.wellosoft.net), there's no way I can tell myself how I'm obsessed with higher dimensions.

This project started since four years ago when I'm *wrongly* interpret what's a four dimensional shape looks like, although it's still beautiful.

2 years ahead I came with correct implementation on how to render a high dimensional object. There's two projection model I offered: The ordinary frustum projection and flatland-way for doing it.

And today? Even much better. I made a [further announcement](https://forum.unity.com/threads/320549/page-2#post-4605418) on Engine4 forum that this project are bootstrapped _again_ to separate them away from Unity Engine -- and now, it has a better name: **Forth Engine**.

Here's the excerpt from my announcement about why I decided to rebootstrap it out from Unity:

> I'm taking a brave decision to move out entirely from Unity Engine. This means I'm switching focus on purely native (C++) form out of this asset. This solves a primary problem of this asset currently encounter: performance and portability.

> I believe this movement also benefits to us on creating more innovative games, as it will scales well on larger project too. By the time of this writing I have been succesfully converted all C# rendering and physics code to C++ even creating some demo examples out of it.

> And also, because C++ gives me low level operations, I can think some algorithms for next features, like UV textures, particle system, GPU accelerated projection, etc.. All core features that defines a Game Engine.

And the best of all, it's [**open sourced**](https://github.com/forth-engine/forth-library). You may ask why, but in the spirit of OSS movements that I do, I put this project on new business model: Dual-licensing, so I hope when initial development got finished, this project will get the attention it deserves, hopefully.
